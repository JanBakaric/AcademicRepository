Project provides a functional system for the management of a repository for academic literature. Included are the functions of literature upload, moderation, download, rating, and review.

Until I reobtain a license for IntelliJ, the project will remain in .zip form.

.exe not included, launched from an IDE.

Further specification will be added if needed.
